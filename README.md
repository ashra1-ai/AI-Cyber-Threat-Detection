## **Introduction**
This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning-based solution for cybersecurity threat detection. By analyzing VPC flow log data, this project detects suspicious patterns, classifies cyberattacks (e.g., DDoS, SQL Injection, Brute Force), and provides actionable insights to secure cloud-based systems.

---

## **Objectives**
- Identify anomalies in web traffic to detect potential threats.
- Classify attack types such as DDoS, SQL Injection, and Brute Force.
- Generate meaningful insights through visualizations to understand attack trends.
- Provide recommendations for strengthening cybersecurity defenses.
